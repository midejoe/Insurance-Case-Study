Statistical Analysis on MedicaInsure data

## Problem Statement

MedicaInsure is a medical insurance provider. Leveraging customer information is of paramount importance for most businesses. In the case of an insurance company, analysis of customer attributes like age, sex, smoking habits, etc. can be crucial in making decisions regarding the premium amount to be charged. 

The insurance company wants to know whether the proportion of female smokers is different from the proportion of male smokers in their customer population.

They have provided a sample dataset of customers and the charges claimed by them.

I used a Two proportions Z-test for this problem.
